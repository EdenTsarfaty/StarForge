        <summary>What are you selling?</summary>
        <p>The store sells futuristic spacecraft parts, upgrades, 
          and rare items that users can use to improve their ships or 
          gain special advantages.
        </p>

        <summary>What additional pages did you add? How to operate them?</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><u>Cargo:</u><br>
            Once per day you can “unload” your vessel's cargo.
            The cargo is filled with pre-determined random items,
            each with its own rarity factor and possible quantity.<br>
            Items can then be sold for store credits.
          </li>
          <li><u>Ship Hangar:</u><br>
            Displays a visual representation of your ship with
            five different components. Each component's condition deteriorates
            daily and must be repaired.<br>
            Repaired components can also be upgraded up to level 3.
          </li>
          <li><u>Market:</u><br>
            An auction house where players can post new auctions and
            bid on those posted by others.<br>
            When the auction's end time has passed, an admin can close it.
            Closing an auction grants the winning user (if there is one) the item.<br>
            Only admins can view expired auctions.
          </li>
          <li><u>Profile:</u><br>
            A page where users can view all the data they entered upon registration
            (excluding username) and update it.<br>
            Password changes require verifying the existing password and following
            a strict password policy.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <summary>What was hard to do?</summary>
        <p>
          For the most part, the implementation itself wasn't too difficult, especially later on
          as development progressed. CSS, HTML, and JavaScript became much clearer and
          easier to utilize as I gained more experience.<br>
          What made it challenging, however, was the sheer length of the project - it took me
          over two weeks to complete.
        </p>

      <details>
        <summary>Did you have a partner?</summary>
        <p>Unfortunately not, I was busy with Miluim for a major part of the semester
          and by the time I attended to the project most of the students were already in pairs.

        <summary>Explain how did you test it</summary>
        <p>
          For testing I took two approaches:<br>
          For the first one, I thoroughly tested the website through all the possible API 
          fetches and frontend behaviour upon ending the project.<br>
          This was also prominent through a large part of the development where I tested
          on the go.<br><br>
          For the second approach, I wrote a very extensive prompt for chatGPT to use node
          fetch to test all my APIs calls. This was mostly technical and repeating code,
          which was over 500 lines long, so it was perfect for AI, however it did require a
          lot of time and work to adjust after all.
